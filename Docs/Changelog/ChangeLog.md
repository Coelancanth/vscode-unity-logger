# [2024-12-21 19:38:09] **Logger System Implementation Using SOLID Principles**

This document outlines how the Logger system adheres to the SOLID principles and provides instructions for usage and customization.

## **SOLID Principles in the Logger System**

### **1. Single Responsibility Principle**
- **`IVariableCapture`**: Handles only variable discovery and capture.
- **`ILogger`**: Handles only logging functionality.
- **`Logger`**: Coordinates between capture and logging.
- **`LoggerEditor`**: Handles only UI representation in the Inspector.

---

### **2. Open/Closed Principle**
- All core functionality is interface-based:
  - New logging implementations can be added without modifying existing code.
  - New variable capture methods can be added by implementing `IVariableCapture`.

---

### **3. Liskov Substitution Principle**
- All implementations can be substituted for their interfaces:
  - Default implementations (`ReflectionVariableCapture`, `UnityDebugLogger`) adhere to interface contracts.

---

### **4. Interface Segregation Principle**
- Small, focused interfaces:
  - **`ILogger`**: Defines logging behavior.
  - **`IVariableCapture`**: Defines variable capture behavior.
- No implementation is forced to implement unnecessary methods.

---

### **5. Dependency Inversion Principle**
- High-level `Logger` depends on abstractions (`ILogger`, `IVariableCapture`):
  - Concrete implementations can be swapped via `SetLogger` and `SetVariableCapture`.

---

## **Usage Instructions**

1. **Attach the Logger component** to any GameObject in your scene.
2. **Assign the target component** you want to monitor.
3. Use the custom inspector to:
   - Select variables to monitor.
   - Toggle logging on start.
   - Manually trigger logging.
   - Refresh the variable list.

---

## **Customization**

### **1. Create Custom `ILogger` Implementations**
- Add new logging destinations (e.g., file, network).
- Example:
  - `ConsoleLogger` for CLI applications.
  - `NetworkLogger` for remote monitoring.

### **2. Create Custom `IVariableCapture` Implementations**
- Add new variable discovery methods.
- Example:
  - Capturing public fields only.
  - Filtering variables by attributes.

### **3. Modify Logging Format**
- Use the `SetFormat` method in `ILogger` to customize the log output format.

---

## **Key Features**

- **Extensible**: Add new functionality without modifying existing code.
- **Dynamic Monitoring**: Easily switch monitored variables and logging behavior via the Inspector.
- **Interface-Driven**: Designed with flexibility and maintainability in mind.
