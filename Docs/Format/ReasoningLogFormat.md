    - Code Structure
    - Key Features
    - Next Steps
    - Testing Strategy




# Requirement Analysis Format

## **Background and Objectives**  
- **Purpose:** Briefly describe the function or role of this module within the overall system.  
- **Reason:** Explain why this functionality needs to be developed.  

---

## **Functional Requirements**  
- Refine the functional requirements into specific items based on the system design document.    

**Example:**  
- Functional requirement description  
- **Input:** Data or parameters  
- **Output:** Result or format  

---

## **Non-Functional Requirements**  
- Describe the requirements for performance, scalability, maintainability, reusability, etc.  

**Example:**  
1. **Performance Requirements:** System response time, throughput, etc.  
2. **Scalability:** Support for future functional expansion or modifications.  
3. **Maintainability:** Ensure the code structure is clear and easy to maintain or upgrade.  
4. **Reproducibility:** Ensure consistent results under identical conditions.  

---

## **Input/Output Data**  
- List the **input data** and **output results** of the module, including data formats or data types.  

**Example:**  
- **Input:**  
   - Parameter1: Data type / format  
   - Parameter2: Data type / format  

- **Output:**  
   - Result1: Data type / format  

---

## **Dependencies and Constraints**  
- **Dependencies:** List the module's dependencies on other systems, components, or tools.  
- **Constraints:** List the technical, design, or business limitations.  

**Example:**  
- **Dependencies:**  
   - Component A: Provides functionality B  
   - Library X: Supports data parsing  

- **Constraints:**  
   - Must complete processing within a fixed time.  
   - The module's resource consumption must not exceed a defined threshold.  

---

## **Success Criteria and Boundary Conditions**  
- **Success Criteria:** Describe the acceptance standards for the module, defining when it can be considered "complete."  
- **Boundary Conditions:** Define the module's scope and limitations for external interactions.  

**Example:**  
- **Success Criteria:**  
   1. When input parameter A is provided, the module outputs result B.  
   2. The system generates consistent results for identical inputs.  

- **Boundary Conditions:**  
   1. The module only processes input data in a specific format.  
   2. If certain parameters are not provided, default values are used as output criteria.  

# **Decision Making**
- If possible, list all solutions you can think of.
- Then, list the pros and cons of each solution.
- Finally, choose the best solution.

# Implementation Plan Format

## **Introduction**  
- Provide an overview of the implementation plan, referencing the design document.  
- State the purpose of the implementation plan and what it aims to achieve.  

---

## **Core Tasks**  
- Break down the implementation into major tasks or milestones based on the design.  
- Each task should be clearly defined and described. Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.  

---

## **Code Structure and Components**  
- Outline the key classes, interfaces, and data structures that need to be implemented.  
- Link these components to the functionality described in the design document.  

---

## **Dependencies**  
- List all tools, libraries, systems, or components that the implementation depends on.  
- Clearly describe how they will be integrated or interacted with.  

---
## **Data Flow**
- Describe the data flow of the module. (input/ output)


---
## **Usage**
- Describe how to use the module.
---

## **Testing Strategy**  
- Describe how you will test the implementation.  
- Include unit testing, integration testing, and any edge cases.  


---

## **Risks and Mitigations**  
- Identify potential risks that may arise during implementation and propose mitigation strategies.  

---

## **Next Steps**  
- Describe subsequent actions, like integration with other systems, reviews, or performance optimizations.
